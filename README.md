# Untitled-the-adventure-game
UNTITLED! The adventure game!

Welcome to this little project.
The main purpose of this project, is for me to practice Python.
Making it a playable game is secundary.
Making the code and filestructure clean unfurtunatly ended up being tertiary.
It is more of a proof of concept than a proper game.
I will do better in my next project.

The project runs on Python 3, and is dependent on tkinter.
The main file to run is "main.py".
There is also an editor for all the text displayed in the game. To run this, run the file "texteditor.py"

Becouse there, as of right now, there is no lauch program, you need to launch from a command line.

To run this, clone or download the project, open a commandline, change directory to the project directory, then run the command
"python main.py" or "python3 main.py", if your system happens to use python2 by default.

Known issues as of now:
 * None, please report.
