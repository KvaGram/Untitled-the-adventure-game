</APT_BED>
<APT_BED_QUEST>
What do you wish to do?
</APT_BED_QUEST>

<APT_DREAM>
Weeeee.. you are flying through the sky!
Below you is a beautiful forest, as green as anything you could ever imagine!
Deep down you know you are dreaming, but you can't quite get yourself to wake up.
suddenly you are in a vintage open cockpit biplane flying over the same lands...
                            **CRASH**

Your eyes shook open! Out the window you see the landscape you pictured in your dream.
It seems so nice, yet something seems off. Everything seems off.
You even struggle to remember your own name... 
What.. was.. what was your name?
</APT_DREAM>

<!--NOTE: This is list. It is split by lines. Keep each excuse as a one-liner.-->
<APT_NAME_EXCUSES>
or maybe it was
no why would.. that be my name.. no it must be
no.. ugh.. why can't I remember my name. Maybe it was
no no no no! That can't be right, so it must be
no, I think that's my best friend's name. wait, I got a best friend?? ugh.. what is my name??
</APT_NAME_EXCUSES>

<APT_NAME_SUBMIT>
This is my name
</APT_NAME_SUBMIT>

<APT_NAME_CONFIRM>
ugh.. Was it {game.PlayerName}?
</APT_NAME_CONFIRM>

<APT_NAME_CONFIRMED>
Yes {game.PlayerName} the.. uhh.. something something title titles..
You are sure you'll remember soon enough. Your head is quite foggy.
You think you might have a headache, but you are not sure.
Looking around you see you are in a small room, an apartment maybe? Maybe a hotel room?
You are sitting on the edge of a large bed. Next to the bed is a small table.
On the table there are some small white spheres, a glass of water and two framed pictures face down
At the head end of the bed there is a window.
Towards the end of the room there is a sink with a mirror.
At the end is a door, probably the exit by the looks of it.
</APT_NAME_CONFIRMED>

<APT_SINK_1>
You walk to the sink.
You see glass shards in the sink.
The mirror is broken.
What little of yourself you can see looks like a mess.
You might want to find a proper bathroom and freshen up a bit.
</APT_SINK_1>
<APT_SINK_2>
The mirror is still broken.
</APT_SINK_2>

<APT_WINDOW_1>
You look through the window into the lush forest landscape.
...
The nature seems oddly calming, yet somehow uncanny
...
...
As you move your head around to look form different angles, you notice a subtle lag.
...
You recognize this now.
It is a hologram.
Probably a cheap class 3 eye-tracking laser-holo, you suddenly realize.
Not that you remember what that is, or what it means.
Only that you had a class 5 back..
...
back home...
..had.. back home...
so this isn't home then...?
</APT_WINDOW_1>
<APT_WINDOW_2>
You enjoy the holographic nature outside the window.
...
...
a holographic deer just walked past.
....
Time to go.

<APT_GLASS_5>you left the glass alone</APT_GLASS_5>
<APT_GLASS_6>The glass is empty</APT_GLASS_6>

<APT_CYAN_1>
You stare closely at the man in the cyan framed picture.
He looks familiar. Very familiar.
You seem to remember he insisted you did not need some expensive frame for his picture.
You study his features closely.
Suddenly it clicks in your mind.
You recognize him now. You think you remeber his name.
</APT_CYAN_1>
<APT_CYAN_SUBMIT>That's his name.</APT_CYAN_SUBMIT>
<APT_CYAN_2>
That's right! It's {game.MaleFam.name} your {game.MaleFam.GenderedRole}!
</APT_CYAN_2>
<APT_CYAN_3>
It is {game.MaleFam.name} your {game.MaleFam.GenderedRole}.
</APT_CYAN_3>
<APT_GOLD_1>
You stare closely at the lady in the gold framed picture.
You study her close, trying to remember who she is.
As you are looking in her eyes when you realize who she is.
You suddenly recall her name!
</APT_GOLD_1>
<APT_GOLD_SUBMIT>That's her name.</APT_GOLD_SUBMIT>
<APT_GOLD_2>
{game.FemaleFam.name} was her name! It's {game.FemaleFam.name} your {game.FemaleFam.GenderedRole}! How could you have forgotten?
</APT_GOLD_2>
<APT_GOLD_3>
It is {game.FemaleFam.name} your {game.FemaleFam.GenderedRole}.
</APT_GOLD_3>

<DOOR_1>
You walk towards the door.
Suddenly there is a sharp spike of pain in your head.
When it is over you are back on the bed, panting.
</DOOR_1>
<DOOR_2>
You walk to the door.
Your head is starting to clear up.
You open the door, and walk out.
</DOOR_2>

A man going inside the ladies room would normally be seen as quite perverted.
But as it is, the ladies is as vacant of people as the rest of this place.

Some of the mirrors are broken, but you found one that was relativly intact.

<MIDDLE_INTRO_1>
You may still be a bit dizzy, as you could swear the floor bends a bit upwards both ways.
The lights flicker, and you see random trash, maybe forgotten items, strewn around the floor.
As the door closes, you note there is a number-plate on your door.
There is an uneasy silence.
</MIDDLE_INTRO_1>
<MIDDLE_INTRO_2>
You exit out of your room and behold the large corridor streching as far as you can see in either direction.

<MIDDLE_INTRO_5>
You are standing in the long corridor
</MIDDLE_INTRO_5>

<MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_1>
The corridor gives way to a large column, splitting the corridor to go around it on both sides.
On two sides of the column you find large hatches with a colored engraving
        |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|
        |    EMERGENCY ESCAPE   |

        |_______________________|

You locate the panel as indicated on the engraving.
</MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_1>
<MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_2>
The glass is already broken.
</MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_2>
<MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_3>
The glass look thin and you feel an odd temtation to smash it.
Written on the glass is a warning.
    FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY!
    SECURITY WILL BE ALERTED TO MISUSE!
</MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_3>

<MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTERQUEST_1>Smash the glass?</MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTERQUEST_1>

    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
</MIDDLE_READ_ROOM_2A68>

<MIDDLE_SEC_D_DOOR>
You stare at the large solid door in front of you.
There is a painted engraving on the door, it reads
    _________________________
    |      C - 2 SECTOR D    |
    |      EMERGENCY DOOR    |
    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
There is a small reinforced window on the door, you look through it.
On the other side you see a corridor much like the one you are in
except, the lights are all off, and a number of dead bodies litter the floor.
What happened here?
</MIDDLE_SEC_D_DOOR>
<MIDDLE_SEC_C_DOOR>
You stare at the large solid door in front of you.
There is a painted engraving on the door, it reads
    ____________________________
    |     C - 2 SECTOR C       |
    |      EMERGENCY DOOR      |
    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
There is a small reinforced window on the door, you look through it.
On the other side you see.. nothing. just blackness.
No, that's not quite right. As your eyes get used to the dark,
you see the walls on the other side of the door.
They go on for a bit over a meter, then abruptly ends in uneven bent metal.
And you see some small faint light far back in the darknes, moving.
Stars, you realize. Stars flying upwards. You are staring into space!
</MIDDLE_SEC_C_DOOR>

<AUXCOM_INTRO>
You find a large panel with a screen on wall next to you.
It has the following text painted and engraved under it
        |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|
        |   AUXILLARY COMS      |

        | FOR AUTHORIZED USE    |
        |          ONLY         |
        |_______________________|
Under that you find a smaller panel that seem to invite you to push it.
</AUXCOM_INTRO>
<AUXCOM_LEAVE_1>
You leave the auxillary communications panel alone
</AUXCOM_LEAVE_1>
<AUXCOM_LEAVE_2>
You decide it is not worth bothering with, close the lower panel, and turn to leave.
</AUXCOM_LEAVE_2>
<AUXCOM_OPENQUEST_1>
Push the lower panel?
</AUXCOM_OPENQUEST_1>
<AUXCOM_OPENQUEST_2>
open the panel?
</AUXCOM_OPENQUEST_2>
<AUXCOM_STATUS_1>
You push the panel. The panel lowers as a latch to reveal a keyboard.

        ' AUXILLARY COMS ONLINE. DO YOU WISH TO PLACE A CALL?'
</AUXCOM_STATUS_1>
<AUXCOM_STATUS_2>

<AUXCOM_STATUS_4>
You push the panel. The panel lowers as a latch to reveal a keyboard.
</AUXCOM_STATUS_4>
<AUXCOM_STATUS_5>
The screen turns on, but displays static.
Unseen speakers make some sort of repeated beeping pattern that
seems oddly familiar, but you cannot quite place it.

You notice a handle on the side of the panel the screen is on.
</AUXCOM_STATUS_5>
<AUXCOM_STATUS_6>
Opening the panel you find a mess of vires, some of them lose.
Unfortunetly, none of them are labled, and all have the same port shape.
The only diffrence is the thinkness and color of the cables.

You take a moment to brainstorm ideas on what do with with the cables.
...
..
.
You made a list of things you could try.
</AUXCOM_STATUS_6>

<AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_1>Disconnect thick black cable and plug it into white socket</AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_1>
<AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_2>Plug blue cable into blue socket</AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_2>
<AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_3>disconnect red/white striped cable and plug it in white socket</AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_3>
<AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_4>disconnect red/white striped cable and plug it in blue socket</AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_4>
<AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_5>Disconnect thick Blue cable and plug it into white socket</AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_5>

<AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_8>taste yellow cable</AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_8>
<AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_9>close panel</AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_9>

<AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_CHOOSE>What will you try next?</AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_CHOOSE>

<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1A>
You disconnect the think black cable, and plug it into the white socket.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1A>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1B>
At first, this seems to work, as the system seemed to turn back to life. Alas it were not to last.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1B>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1C>
Suddenly there was some sparks in the area aroud the white socket.
You hear a faint hum.
Then hum then turns into a screeching sound that increase in frequency and volume.
Then a speaker explodes, and the system goes black.
You quickly disconnect the black cable, and put it back to where it was.
You decide not to try that again.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1C>

<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_2>
You insert the blue cable in the blue socket.
...
*blip*
....
..
Nothing...
Other than a faint blip, nothing happened. You scratch this off the list.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_2>

<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_3A>
You plug the red-white striped cable in the white socket.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_3A>

You decide to try and lick the yellow cable again.

Yup, still tingley
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8A>

On a whim you decided to lick the end of the yellow cable.
It had kind of a tingely taste to it.

As you lick, you notice the system reboot, and a robotic voice comes the the speakers.
"(( CONNECTION RE-ESTABLISHED! DO YOU WISH TO PLACE A CALL? ))"

As you lick the cable, the com-system suddenly comes back to life!

Hey! Good job with the reactor!
The accellerator seems to be running stable for now.
It will not last long, but at least we aren't in a hurry any more.
Looks like we got maybe two hours. Though bestnot wait that long.

Alright, what I need you to do now, is to rescue everyone who is stuck in stasis.
Any questions?

Ok, {_P}. I am not gonna lie, you are in a bit of touble. We are gonna do what we can to help you.
We are onboard the Ziruupan reseach vessel Tikrosa-al on route from Sol to Proxima Centauri.
The reason why you are having a hard time to remeber anything, is likly due to the stasis-pod.
Amnesia is a side-effect of the stasis.
Alright, listen up!
The reactor onboard is about to explode, so were about to detach the module when you contacted us.

Look {_P}, I need you to find the emergency ladd..

Hey! I know you. You're {game.FemaleFam.name}'s {game.FemaleFam.GenderedRolePlayer} right?
You're a engineer, right? Maybe you could try to stabilize the reactor temporarily?
There are still lots of people stuck in stasis in the upper ring!

Look, {game.PlayerName}, I woulden't blame you for just making a run for the ladder to save yourself, but you could save those people!

</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_SCREWIT>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_NO>
I see. Well, the reactor will reach a meltdown in just a few minutes, we need to detach the module before then.
You need to hurry! The escape ladder should be nearby. You need to climb up as fast as you can.
In case you need to pass though a locked security door, the code is 0-0-0-0-0. And, please dont ask.
Again, the code is 0-0-0-0-0!
We will meet you at the airlock in the module core.
Please beware, you will be weightless up here!
See you soon!

(The call has ended)
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_NO>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_YES>
Thanks for doing this!
Ok, there won't be much time, but we will hold off detaching the module as long as we can.
First of, you need a translation device. There should be a few in the cafeteria.
Without one, you would have a hard time reading the manuals and displays.
Once you have one, you need to get down to the outer ring.
Do not use the elevators, that system is down. You will need to climb the emergency ladders

You should find the emergency stairs nearby. You need to climb down to the outermost ring.
The nearest reactor-node will not be far from the ladder.
You need to first initalize the emergency cooling system, then the emergency particle decelerator.
In that order! You will find detailed manuals on how to do this in the reactor-node control room.
Doing this will buy us maybe an hour or two before meltdown.
In case you need to pass though a locked security door, the code is 0-0-0-0-0. And, please dont ask.
Again, the code is 0-0-0-0-0!
You need to hurry! Get back and contact us again once you have done it!

There was the revolt down in the outer ring,

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_1B>
No? Well, then there must be more of you awake down there {_P},
you should get in contact with them as soon as possible.
They would likly be down below you in the outer ring
also known as the {OUTER_RING_NAME}.

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_2A>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_2B>
It was you who fixed the reactor, wasen't it?
{game.FemaleFam.name} warned me you were as good a jokesteer as an engineer, {game.PlayerName}.
Besides, I can tell. Your voice carries some residual effect from someone resently exposed to micro-time loops.

{_REACT_1}
Anyways, please hold the line for a bit, I'm gonna get some help.
(The woman you were talking leaves)
...
(A man, an engineer by the looks of his attire, takes her place)
Alright, {_P}, I am not gonna lie. You are in a bit of trouble.
But thanks to the temporary fix to the reactor, we got some time.
First of, since we got the time, let me explain what has happened.

The reason why you are having a hard time to remeber anything, is likly due to the stasis-pod.
Amnesia is a side-effect of the stasis.
Your memories will come back to you slowly over time.
Quite slowly in fact.
Last time it took me a year to even remeber the invasion.
I suppose I should fill you in. Here's the short.

We are onboard the Ziruupan reseach vessel Tikrosa-al on route from Sol to Proxima Centauri.
Some 10 or so years ago now, the Ziruup Empire invaded Earth.
Well, as much as you could call it an invasion.
Their fighterplanes were armed with semi-automatic ballistas.
And their soldiers were armed with primitive spears.
From what we heard from the radio, they called it the "5 hour world war" back home.

Still, they managed to abduct a good number of us from around the world befo..
(the man is rudely interrupted by a third person)

Hey! I know you. You're {game.FemaleFam.name}'s {game.FemaleFam.GenderedRolePlayer} right?
Thanks for fixing the reactor! {game.FemaleFam.name} told me you were good with machines, {game.PlayerName}, I guess this proves it.
{_REACT_2}
We should probobly have you checked out in the infirmery once you get up here.
But for now, we need your help.

About two hundered people were stuck in stasis during the evacuation.
It is up to you. With the reactor temporarally fixed, we got maybe two hours before we need to detach the module.
I need you to climb up to the inner ring, and awake everyone who is still alive in there.
You will need a securitycode to enter the stasis chambers. The code is 0-0-0-0-0.
Yes, really. just 0-0-0-0-0.

Any questions?

</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_OPTION_3>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_WHY>
There is a problem with the doors up here.
Look, it's complicated. They were designed by aliens after all.
Sufficed to say, we can't go in, but you and anyone you rescue can come out.
I'm not a door technician, I barely understand the problem myself.
Not sure if we got the time for me to properly explain it.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_WHY>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_CODE>
Well.. yeah.. we never expected there to ever be some kind of security issue onboard,
and we kinda still don't, so we never bothered to change the factory settings.
Don't worry about it.

Ok then. Hope to see you here soon.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_EXIT>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_TRUTH>
Ok then. Here are the full story
We are onboard the Ziruupan reseach vessel Tikrosa-al on route from Sol to Proxima Centauri.
Some 10 or so years ago now, the Ziruup Empire invaded Earth.

Well, as much as you could call it an invasion.
Their fighterplanes were armed with semi-automatic ballistas.
And their soldiers were armed with primitive spears.
They landed worldwide en-masse, and started abucting people.
That's how we ended up here.
I seem to remeber you said you were at a tourist spot in America when you were taken.
Anyways, some of us had radios with us when abducted, and from what we heard,
they called it the "5 hour world war" back home.
Clearly spears and ballistas don't do well against tanks and jet-fighters.
...
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_TRUTH>


<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_INTERRUPT_QUEST>
Ask for the short story?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_INTERRUPT_QUEST>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_SHORT_STORY>
Uh? Ok, I will short it down.
Most of us is kept in stasis chambers between research project.
Ziruupan scientists usually just do social studies of us, so most of us cooperate.
But earlier today, some a more fanatical scientists decided to disect some of us.
This is what led to the riot that damaged the reactor.

IS there anything else you want to know?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_SHORT_STORY>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_FULL_STORY>
All in all, Ziruup forces abucted 451 people during the retreat.
Along with several tons of precius metals, equiptment, food supplies from places they raided.
They also raided a dump for some reason, so we got a cargo bay filled with all sort of rubbish.

Well, as we left Earth at a speed faster than anything that could be lauched from Earth, we all soon realized we were trapped.
There were an attempt to take control of the vessel, but...
Well, spears and ballistas do well against unarmed people.

After the initial fighting was over, we were forced into this habitat wheel.
Many of us, being familiar with science fiction and alien abduction stories, expected some grusome experiements.
But none of that came to be. The studies the aliens did to us initially were social.
They wanted to understand our langauges, cultures, social structure, physical strength, etc.
It was easy to cooperate.

Since our food supply was limited to what was raided, most of us agreed to enter into stasis.
Well, except the ones who refused to cooperate at all. They were forced into stasis.

Over the years we talked our Zirtuupan captors into letting us upgrade our habitat to make it more livable.
Installing common comfort from what we could from the raided supplies and equiptment.
Soon enough, some of our captors started to see us more as accidental ambassadors.

Some that is. Many still belive we should all be slaves for their emperror.
One of the more fanatical scientists decided to go ahead with a disection project, and defrosted a group of malcontent abductees from stasis.
Her reasoning were that since they diden't want to cooperate, they might as well be used to learn our atanomy.
This did not go well.

Since this was done in secret, there weren't many guards protecting the lab.
And so they broke free, started a revolt many others joined in on.
They, or should I say we. Some of us up here were part of the riot.
Anyways, we started to destroy the laboretories in the outer ring.
We diden't know about the reactor back then.
So the thinking was that the worst that could happen were getting vented into space.

We diden't notice at first, but as the lab blew, it pushed the reactor particle accellerator ring out of allignment.
The alarm started as hole-breaches started appearing all over in sector D on all rings. And then later in sector C.
An Zirtuupan engineer told us what was could happen, and so we started evacuating, or more like panicing.
As we started defrosting people en-masse, the already disorderly evacuation turned into an outright stampede.

Just as we got the last group though of paniced folks though, the doors decided to glitch up.
Then you suddenly contacted us. Good thing you did. We were about to edject the module,
using the internal atmosphere as thurst. You would have been sucked out into space had we done that.

Sorry you got left down there.
But the important thing now is to get you and everyone else stuck in the module out before we blow this thing.

Do you have any more questions?

As you push off from the laddershaft, you fly upwards in the low gravity.
You reach the center, finding yourself entierly weightless.
You take hold on a rotating pole. Soon the pole seemed to stop rotating, and the room started rotating around you.
You see the ladder you came out from now no longer as "down", but as part of the wall.
From your perspective, "up" has become a set of reinforced windows at one end of the sphere.
"Down" has become a large open doorway, with a sign lableing it "airlock".
That being said, had you turned yourself the other way, it would be the other way around.

You look back, and see the shutters close.
You hear more bangs, debris hitting the shutters.
Might be a good idea to get out of there.
</CORE_WINDOW_1>
<CORE_WINDOW_1_PART_A>
Unlike the 'window' in the room you woke up in, this window was at least not holographic.
You could tell by the lack of lag when you moved your head, the large solid sliding shutters on both sides of the window
uh and the fact you are looking out into space, and not an idyllic forest.
</CORE_WINDOW_1_PART_A>
<CORE_WINDOW_1_PART_B>
The window gives you a great view into space, it is quite impressive view.
You take note of the large solid sliding shutters on both sides of the window.
</CORE_WINDOW_1_PART_B>
<CORE_WINDOW_2>
You look back at the window area. The window is closed by the huge metal shutter.
You still hear the occational clang and bang.
You decide not to get closer, just in case.
</CORE_WINDOW_2>

<FLOAT_TO_QUEST>
Float over to it?
</FLOAT_TO_QUEST>

<CORE_TO_ELE_A>
You look at the elevator access rotating around.
A huge A is painted on it.
</CORE_TO_ELE_A>
<CORE_TO_ELE_C>
You look at the elevator access rotating around.
A huge C is painted on it.
</CORE_TO_ELE_C>
<CORE_TO_LADDER_B>
You look over to the ladder access rotating around.
It has a huge B painted on it.
</CORE_TO_LADDER_B>
<CORE_TO_LADDER_D>
You look over to the ladder access rotating around.
It has a huge D painted on it.
</CORE_TO_LADDER_D>

<CORE_ELE_C>
You push off and float to the elevator.
When you got there, you noticed a flashing electoric board flashing a read light
and text in english and in alien script:
BRECH DETECTED! NO ACCESS!
You take off back to the pole.
</CORE_ELE_C>
<CORE_LADDER_D>
You push off and float to the ladder.
When you got there, you noticed a flashing electoric board flashing a read light and the text:
BRECH DETECTED! NO ACCESS!
You took off back to the pole.
</CORE_LADDER_D>

<CORE_AIRLOCK_1>
You look "down" towards the huge door "below".
Taking in the details, you see the pole ending a bit before it, splitting into 4 aches around the doorway.
Like the pole itself, the doorway was fixed, and not rotating with the room.
On a closer look, there is a secund doorway past it, and two more again, with only some small gap of room between them.
The inner-most door are closed, but has some large windows where you can see the area past it, clearly.
</CORE_AIRLOCK_1>
<CORE_AIRLOCK_1_QUEST>
Take off towards the doorway?
</CORE_AIRLOCK_1_QUEST>
<CORE_AIRLOCK_2>
You rotate yourself so the doorway was now "above" you.
You take off, pushing and dragging along the pole untill you reach the doorway.
</CORE_AIRLOCK_2>
<CORE_AIRLOCK_2_QUEST>
enter the doorway?
</CORE_AIRLOCK_2_QUEST>
<CORE_AIRLOCK_3A>
You enter through the first two doorways.
you note the middle section between the doors were diffrent than the other two.
It was shorter and had a seam down the middle.
As you were floating though, you were greeted by someone who suddenly floated into view.
</CORE_AIRLOCK_3A>
<CORE_AIRLOCK_3B>
For whatever reason, you decide to drag yourself back to the pole.
As you turned around, you noticed some people float into view on the, with confused looks.
</CORE_AIRLOCK_3B>

<!--FRAGS:

-->
<CARGOBAY_ENDING>
As you appreach the innermost door, you hear a muffled barely audiable voice from the other side.
{_INTRO_PART}

Are you alright there {0}? The door is a bit broken,
so I need you to hold down that lever there while we open the door

{_REACTION}

{_FOLLOWUP}

{_END}
        END OF CHAPTER 1
</CARGOBAY_ENDING>
<CARGOBAY_INTRO_PART_A>
Hey, you must be {_P}!
</CARGOBAY_INTRO_PART_A>
<CARGOBAY_INTRO_PART_B>
What the? A survivor! Quick, let's open the door and get {_P} inside!
</CARGOBAY_INTRO_PART_B>

<CARGOBAY_REACTION_A>
Well, you saved a few people, {_NUM_PEOPLE_SAVED} by last count, that would otherwise die.
I suppose that's something we can be thankfull for. Sad there are still so many more stuck down there.
</CARGOBAY_REACTION_A>
<CARGOBAY_REACTION_B>
Thank you {_P}. We never expected you to evacuate so many people on your lonesome. Sorry we could not help.
By our last count, we're at {_NUM_PEOPLE_SAVED}, excluding you.
</CARGOBAY_REACTION_B>
<CARGOBAY_REACTION_C>
What happened? You fixed the reactor. Was there something wrong with the stasis chambers? Why haven't you evacuated anyone, {_P}?
</CARGOBAY_REACTION_C>
<CARGOBAY_REACTION_D>
Well, at least we got you out of there in time.
</CARGOBAY_REACTION_D>

<CARGOBAY_FOLLOWUP_A>
Well, proper congratulations will have to wait.
You should join the others in the infirmary.
And we need to detatch the module now! Hurry on now!
</CARGOBAY_FOLLOWUP_A>
<CARGOBAY_FOLLOWUP_B>
Wish we could get more people out of there, but it's too late now.
Without that improvised dead-man switch on the other side there, this door is locked for good.
You best head to the infirmary.
We need to detach the module before it's too late.
</CARGOBAY_FOLLOWUP_B>

<CARGOBAY_ENDING_A>
You push and drag your way following the signs to the infirmary in wheel A section A1
You try not to think about how maybe you could have saved some of the people stuck in stasis.
You excuse it in your mind by saying to yourself that there was nothing you could have done for them.
Though in a way, you know that's a lie.
</CARGOBAY_ENDING_A>
<CARGOBAY_ENDING_B>
You push and drag your way following the signs to the infirmary in wheel A section A1
You try not to think about all the people you left behind, focusing instead on the few you did save
</CARGOBAY_ENDING_B>
<CARGOBAY_ENDING_C>
You join the last group of surviors you saved on the way to the infirmary.
Pushing and dragging your ways to wheel A, you meet a crew-member.
You get told that the wheel A infirmary is full, so you change course to Wheel D.
As if from nowhere, {game.MaleFam.name}, your {game.MaleFam.GenderedRole} pokes you on your shoulder.
Apperently, he was in the last group, and you had not even noticed.
Neither had he. Stasis sickness being what it is.
Passing the computer core on the way, you got reaquiented with your {game.FemaleFam.GenderedRole} {game.FemaleFam.name} too, who pushed out of the room below you and hugged you.
putting both of you in a real awkward spin in the microgravity, untill she got a hold on the railing, stopping you both.
</CARGOBAY_ENDING_C>
<CARGOBAY_ENDING_D>
Hearing that comment, you got an odd feeling. How could you have known there were more people missing?
And that you could have helped them? As you push and drag your way to the infirmary in wheel A,
you conclude there was no way you could have known.
...
It is of little comfort.
