<MIDDLE_INTRO_1>
You may still be a bit dizzy, as you could swear the floor bends a bit upwards both ways.
The lights flicker, and you see random trash, maybe forgotten items, strewn around the floor.
As the door closes, you note there is a number-plate on your door.
There is an uneasy silence.
</MIDDLE_INTRO_1>
<MIDDLE_INTRO_2>
You exit out of your room and behold the large corridor streching as far as you can see in either direction.
</MIDDLE_INTRO_2>
<MIDDLE_INTRO_3>
You close the emergency ladder's hatch.
You are now at the middle level ring.
</MIDDLE_INTRO_3>
<MIDDLE_INTRO_4>
You exit the bathrooms and returned to the corridor.
</MIDDLE_INTRO_4>
<MIDDLE_INTRO_5>
You are standing in the long corridor
</MIDDLE_INTRO_5>

<MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_1>
The corridor gives way to a large column, splitting the corridor to go around it on both sides.
On two sides of the column you find large hatches with a colored engraving
        |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|
        |    EMERGENCY ESCAPE   |
        |      WHEEL C RING 2   |

        |       PULL LEVER      |
        |        TO OPEN        |
        |_______________________|

You locate the panel as indicated on the engraving.
</MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_1>
<MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_2>
The glass is already broken.
</MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_2>
<MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_3>
The glass look thin and you feel an odd temtation to smash it.
Written on the glass is a warning.
    FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY!
    SECURITY WILL BE ALERTED TO MISUSE!
</MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_3>

<MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTERQUEST_1>Smash the glass?</MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTERQUEST_1>
<MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTERQUEST_2>Pull the lever?</MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTERQUEST_2>

</MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTER_1>
<MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTER_2>
You smash the glass, and pull the lever.
The hatch opens and you go inside.
</MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTER_2>

The sign on the door reads
    ______________________

    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
</MIDDLE_READ_ROOM_2A68>

<MIDDLE_SEC_D_DOOR>
You stare at the large solid door in front of you.
There is a painted engraving on the door, it reads
    _________________________
    |      C - 2 SECTOR D    |
    |      EMERGENCY DOOR    |
    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
There is a small reinforced window on the door, you look through it.
On the other side you see a corridor much like the one you are in
except, the lights are all off, and a number of dead bodies litter the floor.
What happened here?
</MIDDLE_SEC_D_DOOR>
<MIDDLE_SEC_C_DOOR>
You stare at the large solid door in front of you.
There is a painted engraving on the door, it reads
    ____________________________
    |     C - 2 SECTOR C       |
    |      EMERGENCY DOOR      |
    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
There is a small reinforced window on the door, you look through it.
On the other side you see.. nothing. just blackness.
No, that's not quite right. As your eyes get used to the dark,
you see the walls on the other side of the door.
They go on for a bit over a meter, then abruptly ends in uneven bent metal.
And you see some small faint light far back in the darknes, moving.
Stars, you realize. Stars flying upwards. You are staring into space!
</MIDDLE_SEC_C_DOOR>

<AUXCOM_INTRO>
You find a large panel with a screen on wall next to you.
It has the following text painted and engraved under it
        |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|
        |   AUXILLARY COMS      |

        | FOR AUTHORIZED USE    |
        |          ONLY         |
        |_______________________|
Under that you find a smaller panel that seem to invite you to push it.
</AUXCOM_INTRO>
<AUXCOM_LEAVE_1>
You leave the auxillary communications panel alone
</AUXCOM_LEAVE_1>
<AUXCOM_LEAVE_2>
You decide it is not worth bothering with, close the lower panel, and turn to leave.
</AUXCOM_LEAVE_2>
<AUXCOM_OPENQUEST_1>
Push the lower panel?
</AUXCOM_OPENQUEST_1>
<AUXCOM_OPENQUEST_2>
open the panel?
</AUXCOM_OPENQUEST_2>
<AUXCOM_STATUS_1>
You push the panel. The panel lowers as a latch to reveal a keyboard.

        ' AUXILLARY COMS ONLINE. DO YOU WISH TO PLACE A CALL?'
</AUXCOM_STATUS_1>
<AUXCOM_STATUS_2>
You push the panel.  The panel lowers as a latch to reveal a keyboard.

        'CONNECTION RE-ESTABLISHED! DO YOU WISH TO PLACE A CALL?'
</AUXCOM_STATUS_3>
<AUXCOM_STATUS_4>
You push the panel. The panel lowers as a latch to reveal a keyboard.
</AUXCOM_STATUS_4>
<AUXCOM_STATUS_5>
The screen turns on, but displays static.
Unseen speakers make some sort of repeated beeping pattern that
seems oddly familiar, but you cannot quite place it.

You notice a handle on the side of the panel the screen is on.
</AUXCOM_STATUS_5>
<AUXCOM_STATUS_6>
Opening the panel you find a mess of vires, some of them lose.
Unfortunetly, none of them are labled, and all have the same port shape.
The only diffrence is the thinkness and color of the cables.

You take a moment to brainstorm ideas on what do with with the cables.
...
..
.
You made a list of things you could try.
</AUXCOM_STATUS_6>

<AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_1>Disconnect thick black cable and plug it into white socket</AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_1>

<AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_CHOOSE>What will you try next?</AUXCOM_WIREOPTION_CHOOSE>

<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1A>
You disconnect the think black cable, and plug it into the white socket.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1A>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1B>
At first, this seems to work, as the system seemed to turn back to life. Alas it were not to last.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1B>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1C>
Suddenly there was some sparks in the area aroud the white socket.
You hear a faint hum.
Then hum then turns into a screeching sound that increase in frequency and volume.
Then a speaker explodes, and the system goes black.
You quickly disconnect the black cable, and put it back to where it was.
You decide not to try that again.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_1C>

<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_2>
You insert the blue cable in the blue socket.
...

</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_2>

<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_3A>
You plug the red-white striped cable in the white socket.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_3A>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_3B>
But nothing happened, and the system is still shut down.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_3B>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_3C>
The beeps stop, and you notice the screen stops playing static.
You check the screen
....
'What th..'
you are about to say when all you saw was a flat blue line.
But then you noticed it made a wave as you talked.
Well, that's very 'useful'
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_3C>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_3D>
You disconnect the red-white striped cable.
That was a blind end.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_3D>

<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_4A>
You plug the red-white striped cable in the blue socket.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_4A>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_4B>
But nothing happened, and the system is still shut down.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_4B>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_4C>
You hear an extra beep as you plug in the cable, but nothing else.
The screen blinks, but seems to be back to show ing static.
You check the screen, and you notice the screen now shows something behind the static.
....
'What the..'
you say as you notice a number of red white and blue flags burned into the background of the static.
Well, that's.. colorful...
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_4C>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_4D>
You disconnect the red-white striped cable.
That was a blind end.

</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_5C>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_5D>
You unplug the thick blue cable, and plug it back in.
The screen blinks with brief static,
but once again displays black screen with the text 
    'ERROR - PLEASE REBOOT'.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_5D>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_5E>
You plug the thick blue cable in the white slot
You notise the screen suddenly stopped displaying static.
You check the screen, and find it now displays a black background with a text in white
        'ERROR - PLEASE REBOOT'
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_5E>

<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_6>
You unplug the big thick black cable, and stuck out your tongue to lick it.
You're not sure why you just did that.
As you somehow put the cable in your mouth, the world goes black.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_6>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_6_GAMEOVER>
You put a live power-cable in your mouth. Yeah, you're dead.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_6_GAMEOVER>

<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_7A>
You unplug the cable in the black slot, and plug in the yellow.
Nothing happened, and the system is still shut down.
You decide to undo it, plugging the black cable back in.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_7A>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_7B>
You unplug the cable in the black slot, and plug in the yellow.
As you plug in the yellow cable, there was a breif spark, then system shuts down.
You decide to undo it, and never try that again, putting the black cable back in.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_7B>

<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8A>
You decide to try and lick the yellow cable again.
...
Yup, still tingley
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8A>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8B>
On a whim you decided to lick the end of the yellow cable.
It had kind of a tingely taste to it.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8B>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8C>
As you lick, you notice the system reboot, and a robotic voice comes the the speakers.
"(( CONNECTION RE-ESTABLISHED! DO YOU WISH TO PLACE A CALL? ))"
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8C>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8D>
As you lick the cable, the com-system suddenly comes back to life!
Though it is back to just beeps and static
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8D>
<AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8E>
The system blinks and reboots.
Nothing seems to have changed though, still just beeps and static.
</AUXCOM_WIREACTION_8E>

Hey! Good job with the reactor!
The accellerator seems to be running stable for now.
It will not last long, but at least we aren't in a hurry any more.
Looks like we got maybe two hours. Though bestnot wait that long.

Alright, what I need you to do now, is to rescue everyone who is stuck in stasis.
Any questions?
</AUXCOM3_INTRO_THANKS>

<AUXCOM3_INTRO_RETURN>
Hello again.
Again, thanks for fixing the reactor. We still got some time.
Did you have more questions?
</AUXCOM3_INTRO_RETURN>

Hi?
Look, our systems say the reactor is still in a bad condition!
We don't have time to chat!
Either fix the reactor, or get out of there!

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1A>
Ok. {_P}, I need you to stay calm. I'm gonna get some help
(The woman you were talking leaves)
...
(A man, an engineer by the looks of his attire, takes her place)
Ok, {_P}. I am not gonna lie, you are in a bit of touble. We are gonna do what we can to help you.
We are onboard the Ziruupan reseach vessel Tikrosa-al on route from Sol to Proxima Centauri.
The reason why you are having a hard time to remeber anything, is likly due to the stasis-pod.
Amnesia is a side-effect of the stasis.
Alright, listen up!
The reactor onboard is about to explode, so were about to detach the module when you contacted us.

Look {_P}, I need you to find the emergency ladd..
(the man is rudely interrupted by a third person)
Hey! I know you. You're {game.FemaleFam.name}'s {game.FemaleFam.GenderedRolePlayer} right?
You're a engineer, right? Maybe you could try to stabilize the reactor temporarily?
There are still lots of people stuck in stasis in the upper ring!

Look, {game.PlayerName}, I woulden't blame you for just making a run for the ladder to save yourself, but you could save those people!
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_QUEST>
How do you respond?

<!-- Going 'down' is not an error. The player character acually makes this mistake in this option. -->
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_OPTION_1>
Screw them! I'm out of here! I'm gonna climb down and get out of here!
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_OPTION_1>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_OPTION_2>
I.. I am not gonna take that chance. I'm just gonna go meet you up the ladder!
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_OPTION_2>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_OPTION_3>
Alright, how do I get to the reactor?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_OPTION_3>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_OPTION_4>
What exacly happened?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_OPTION_4>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_SCREWIT>
Well, ehm.. that's rude. ..
uh well, sure go DOWN the ladder. Uh, and take your good time too.
Got to go, bye!

(The call has ended)
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_SCREWIT>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_NO>
I see. Well, the reactor will reach a meltdown in just a few minutes, we need to detach the module before then.
You need to hurry! The escape ladder should be nearby. You need to climb up as fast as you can.
In case you need to pass though a locked security door, the code is 0-0-0-0-0. And, please dont ask.
Again, the code is 0-0-0-0-0!
We will meet you at the airlock in the module core.
Please beware, you will be weightless up here!
See you soon!

(The call has ended)
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_NO>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_YES>
Thanks for doing this!
Ok, there won't be much time, but we will hold off detaching the module as long as we can.
First of, you need a translation device. There should be a few in the cafeteria.
Without one, you would have a hard time reading the manuals and displays.
Once you have one, you need to get down to the outer ring.
Do not use the elevators, that system is down. You will need to climb the emergency ladders

You should find the emergency stairs nearby. You need to climb down to the outermost ring.
The nearest reactor-node will not be far from the ladder.
You need to first initalize the emergency cooling system, then the emergency particle decelerator.
In that order! You will find detailed manuals on how to do this in the reactor-node control room.
Doing this will buy us maybe an hour or two before meltdown.
In case you need to pass though a locked security door, the code is 0-0-0-0-0. And, please dont ask.
Again, the code is 0-0-0-0-0!
You need to hurry! Get back and contact us again once you have done it!

(The call has ended)
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_YES>


<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_WUT>
There was the revolt down in the outer ring,
the so-called {OUTER_RING_NAME}.
The fighting damaged the reactor-ring.
We don't have time to discuss details.
I need you to either stabilize the reactor so we can save everyone, or get you safely out of there!
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2A_WUT>



<!-- Alternate dialouge: If the player for some reason fixed the reactor before making contact -->
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_REACTOR_QUEST>
Ok, {_P}, I need you to stay calm. First off I need to know, was it you who stabilized the reactor?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_REACTOR_QUEST>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_1A>
Well, thanks for that, {_P}. We were starting to sweat bullets up here.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_1A>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_1B>
No? Well, then there must be more of you awake down there {_P},
you should get in contact with them as soon as possible.
They would likly be down below you in the outer ring
also known as the {OUTER_RING_NAME}.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_1B>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_2A>
Thanks for fixing the reactor! {game.FemaleFam.name} told me you were good with machines, {game.PlayerName}. I guess this proves it.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_2A>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_2B>
It was you who fixed the reactor, wasen't it?
{game.FemaleFam.name} warned me you were as good a jokesteer as an engineer, {game.PlayerName}.
Besides, I can tell. Your voice carries some residual effect from someone resently exposed to micro-time loops.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B_PART_2B>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B>
{_REACT_1}
Anyways, please hold the line for a bit, I'm gonna get some help.
(The woman you were talking leaves)
...
(A man, an engineer by the looks of his attire, takes her place)
Alright, {_P}, I am not gonna lie. You are in a bit of trouble.
But thanks to the temporary fix to the reactor, we got some time.
First of, since we got the time, let me explain what has happened.

The reason why you are having a hard time to remeber anything, is likly due to the stasis-pod.
Amnesia is a side-effect of the stasis.
Your memories will come back to you slowly over time.
Quite slowly in fact.
Last time it took me a year to even remeber the invasion.
I suppose I should fill you in. Here's the short.

We are onboard the Ziruupan reseach vessel Tikrosa-al on route from Sol to Proxima Centauri.
Some 10 or so years ago now, the Ziruup Empire invaded Earth.
Well, as much as you could call it an invasion.
Their fighterplanes were armed with semi-automatic ballistas.
And their soldiers were armed with primitive spears.
From what we heard from the radio, they called it the "5 hour world war" back home.

Still, they managed to abduct a good number of us from around the world befo..
(the man is rudely interrupted by a third person)

Hey! I know you. You're {game.FemaleFam.name}'s {game.FemaleFam.GenderedRolePlayer} right?
Thanks for fixing the reactor! {game.FemaleFam.name} told me you were good with machines, {game.PlayerName}, I guess this proves it.
{_REACT_2}
We should probobly have you checked out in the infirmery once you get up here.
But for now, we need your help.

About two hundered people were stuck in stasis during the evacuation.
It is up to you. With the reactor temporarally fixed, we got maybe two hours before we need to detach the module.
I need you to climb up to the inner ring, and awake everyone who is still alive in there.
You will need a securitycode to enter the stasis chambers. The code is 0-0-0-0-0.
Yes, really. just 0-0-0-0-0.

Any questions?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_1B>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_QUEST>
How do you respond?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_QUEST>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_OPTION_1>
Why can't you save them?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_OPTION_1>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_OPTION_2>
Why the simple code?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_OPTION_2>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_OPTION_3>
No. I'm on my way
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_OPTION_3>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_WHY>
There is a problem with the doors up here.
Look, it's complicated. They were designed by aliens after all.
Sufficed to say, we can't go in, but you and anyone you rescue can come out.
I'm not a door technician, I barely understand the problem myself.
Not sure if we got the time for me to properly explain it.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_WHY>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_CODE>
Well.. yeah.. we never expected there to ever be some kind of security issue onboard,
and we kinda still don't, so we never bothered to change the factory settings.
Don't worry about it.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_CODE>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_EXIT>
Good luck.

</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_2B_EXIT>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_QUEST>How do you respond?</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_QUEST>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_OPTION_CODE>
What was that code again?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_OPTION_CODE>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_OPTION_TRUTH>
Exacly what happened?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_OPTION_TRUTH>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_OPTION_EXIT>
Not right now. Bye.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_OPTION_EXIT>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_CODE>
As we said earlier, the code is 0-0-0-0-0.
Again, please don't mock us for not changing the factory settings.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_CODE>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_EXIT>
Ok then. Hope to see you here soon.
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_EXIT>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_TRUTH>
Ok then. Here are the full story
We are onboard the Ziruupan reseach vessel Tikrosa-al on route from Sol to Proxima Centauri.
Some 10 or so years ago now, the Ziruup Empire invaded Earth.

Well, as much as you could call it an invasion.
Their fighterplanes were armed with semi-automatic ballistas.
And their soldiers were armed with primitive spears.
They landed worldwide en-masse, and started abucting people.
That's how we ended up here.
I seem to remeber you said you were at a tourist spot in America when you were taken.
Anyways, some of us had radios with us when abducted, and from what we heard,
they called it the "5 hour world war" back home.
Clearly spears and ballistas don't do well against tanks and jet-fighters.
...
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_TRUTH>


<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_INTERRUPT_QUEST>
Ask for the short story?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_INTERRUPT_QUEST>

<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_SHORT_STORY>
Uh? Ok, I will short it down.
Most of us is kept in stasis chambers between research project.
Ziruupan scientists usually just do social studies of us, so most of us cooperate.
But earlier today, some a more fanatical scientists decided to disect some of us.
This is what led to the riot that damaged the reactor.

IS there anything else you want to know?
</AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_SHORT_STORY>
<AUXCOM_DIALOGE_3_FULL_STORY>
All in all, Ziruup forces abucted 451 people during the retreat.
Along with several tons of precius metals, equiptment, food supplies from places they raided.
They also raided a dump for some reason, so we got a cargo bay filled with all sort of rubbish.

Well, as we left Earth at a speed faster than anything that could be lauched from Earth, we all soon realized we were trapped.
There were an attempt to take control of the vessel, but...
Well, spears and ballistas do well against unarmed people.

After the initial fighting was over, we were forced into this habitat wheel.
Many of us, being familiar with science fiction and alien abduction stories, expected some grusome experiements.
But none of that came to be. The studies the aliens did to us initially were social.
They wanted to understand our langauges, cultures, social structure, physical strength, etc.
It was easy to cooperate.

Since our food supply was limited to what was raided, most of us agreed to enter into stasis.
Well, except the ones who refused to cooperate at all. They were forced into stasis.

Over the years we talked our Zirtuupan captors into letting us upgrade our habitat to make it more livable.
Installing common comfort from what we could from the raided supplies and equiptment.
Soon enough, some of our captors started to see us more as accidental ambassadors.

Some that is. Many still belive we should all be slaves for their emperror.
One of the more fanatical scientists decided to go ahead with a disection project, and defrosted a group of malcontent abductees from stasis.
Her reasoning were that since they diden't want to cooperate, they might as well be used to learn our atanomy.
This did not go well.

Since this was done in secret, there weren't many guards protecting the lab.
And so they broke free, started a revolt many others joined in on.
They, or should I say we. Some of us up here were part of the riot.
Anyways, we started to destroy the laboretories in the outer ring.
We diden't know about the reactor back then.
So the thinking was that the worst that could happen were getting vented into space.

We diden't notice at first, but as the lab blew, it pushed the reactor particle accellerator ring out of allignment.
The alarm started as hole-breaches started appearing all over in sector D on all rings. And then later in sector C.
An Zirtuupan engineer told us what was could happen, and so we started evacuating, or more like panicing.
As we started defrosting people en-masse, the already disorderly evacuation turned into an outright stampede.

Just as we got the last group though of paniced folks though, the doors decided to glitch up.
Then you suddenly contacted us. Good thing you did. We were about to edject the module,
using the internal atmosphere as thurst. You would have been sucked out into space had we done that.

Sorry you got left down there.
But the important thing now is to get you and everyone else stuck in the module out before we blow this thing.

Do you have any more questions?
