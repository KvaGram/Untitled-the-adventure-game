<MIDDLE_INTRO_1>
You may still be a bit dizzy, as you could swear the floor bends a bit upwards both ways.
The lights flicker, and you see random trash, maybe forgotten items, strewn around the floor.
As the door closes, you note there is a number-plate on your door.
There is an uneasy silence.
</MIDDLE_INTRO_1>
<MIDDLE_INTRO_2>
You exit out of your room and behold the large corridor streching as far as you can see in either direction.

<MIDDLE_INTRO_5>
You are standing in the long corridor
</MIDDLE_INTRO_5>

<MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_1>
The corridor gives way to a large column, splitting the corridor to go around it on both sides.
On two sides of the column you find large hatches with a colored engraving
        |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|
        |    EMERGENCY ESCAPE   |
        |      WHEEL C RING 2   |

<MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_2>
The glass is already broken.
</MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_2>

The glass look thin and you feel an odd temtation to smash it.
Written on the glass is a warning.
    FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY!
    SECURITY WILL BE ALERTED TO MISUSE!
</MIDDLE_LADDER_INTRO_3>

<MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTERQUEST_1>Smash the glass?</MIDDLE_LADDER_ENTERQUEST_1>

    ______________________
    |   C - 2 SECTOR A   |
    |         068        |
    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
</MIDDLE_READ_ROOM_2A68>

<MIDDLE_SEC_D_DOOR>
You stare at the large solid door in front of you.
There is a painted engraving on the door, it reads
    _________________________
    |      C - 2 SECTOR D    |
    |      EMERGENCY DOOR    |
    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
There is a small reinforced window on the door, you look through it.
On the other side you see a corridor much like the one you are in
except, the lights are all off, and a number of dead bodies litter the floor.
What happened here?
</MIDDLE_SEC_D_DOOR>
<MIDDLE_SEC_C_DOOR>
You stare at the large solid door in front of you.
There is a painted engraving on the door, it reads
    ____________________________
    |     C - 2 SECTOR C       |
    |      EMERGENCY DOOR      |
    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
There is a small reinforced window on the door, you look through it.
On the other side you see.. nothing. just blackness.
No, that's not quite right. As your eyes get used to the dark,
you see the walls on the other side of the door.
They go on for a bit over a meter, then abruptly ends in uneven bent metal.
And you see some small faint light far back in the darknes, moving.
Stars, you realize. Stars flying upwards. You are staring into space!
